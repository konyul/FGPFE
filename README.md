# FG-PFE

---

This is the official implementation of ***FG-PFE***, a new pillar encoding architecture, referred to as Fine-Grained Pillar Feature Encoding (FG-PFE). FG-PFE employs spatio-temporal virtual (STV) grids to capture the distribution of point clouds within each pillar across vertical, temporal, and horizontal dimensions. We implement our method based on PillarNet. The submission is the FG-PFE with a voxel size of (0.075m, 0.075m, 0.2m), including test time augmentation (TTA). The results of an experimental evaluation show that the proposed architecture achieved competitive performance on the nuScenes dataset, with state-of-the-art performances in some 3D object detection benchmark categories.
